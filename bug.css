The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in certain browsers:  ```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  margin: 10px;
}

.item:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: red;
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```  The even-numbered items unexpectedly stretch to fill the available space, even though only the `flex-grow` property is modified. This is an uncommon bug caused by the interaction between `flex-grow`, `align-items:center`, and `justify-content:center`. In some browsers, this causes unexpected distribution of space.
